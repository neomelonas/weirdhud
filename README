Drop resource and scripts into 

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\[USERNAME]\team fortress 2\tf\

Edit the bottom of scripts\hudlayout.res if you want to change the HUD crosshairs.

Most of the HUD is shamelessly stolen from omp's tf2hud, things you can change from his HUD are explained at http://rawr.am/tf2hud/

You can change the ScoreBoard by renaming any of the ScoreboardXXX.res files to Scoreboard.res in the \resources\ui\ directory.  The default is an offcentered 12v12.

Enjoy weirdhud.
